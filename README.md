nodejs for windows
https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.1/node-v8.11.1-x64.msi

In your windows search type node and select the Node.js command prompt

After the cmd is opened type
`npm i -g @angular/cli`

This may take a while. After it is done u will have all packages for a base level anguler server.

# To start an instance of the server run
`ng serve`
in the cmd (node or normal, doesnt matter) while your path is pointing to an anguler project.
